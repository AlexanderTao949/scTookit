\title{Cell-wise Fisher's Exact Test for Contingency Tables}
\usage{
test.dist.table(count.dist, min.rowSum = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{count.dist}{A numeric matrix or data.frame representing the contingency
table, where rows correspond to one categorical variable and columns to another.
Row and column names are preserved in the output.}

\item{min.rowSum}{Numeric threshold for row filtering. Rows with marginal sums
strictly less than this value are excluded from analysis. Default is 0.}
}
\value{
A data.table in long format containing:
  \itemize{
    \item rid: Row identifier (from input rownames)
    \item cid: Column identifier (from input colnames)
    \item count: Observed frequency in the cell
    \item p.value: Two-sided p-value from Fisher's exact test
    \item OR: Estimated odds ratio for the cell against all others
  }
}
\description{
Performs Fisher's exact test on each cell of a contingency table to evaluate
associations between row and column categories. For every cell (i,j), constructs
a 2x2 contingency table comparing the observed count against the row and column
marginals, then calculates odds ratios and p-values.
